                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and resembles Earth in size and density.
                It is primarily composed of rocks and has a thick atmosphere made up of 599 carbon dioxide,
                causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Surface temperatures reach around 494 degrees Celsius,
                making it the hottest planet. Venus takes about 449 Earth days to orbit the Sun,
                while a day on Venus lasts about 403 Earth days. Due to its extreme conditions, Venus
                is not considered habitable. It has been explored by various missions such as Venera and Magellan.
